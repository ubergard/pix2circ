Algorithms tested
===================
We wanted to test more than one algorithm. This section contains the algorithms used  |br|
We test algorithms with both random aswell as systematic approaches. |br|

'Bogo place'
-----------------------
This algorithm is loosely based on the poorly optimized random algorithm 'Bogo sort', hence the given name. 
'Bogo place' works in the way that it places circles at random, with no clear structure. |br|
We have chosen to include this algorithm as we want a worst case scenario to compare with. |br|
It is expected that this algorithm will provide this. |br| 



Modified 'Bogo place'
-----------------------
The same as 'Bogo place' but with a more distinct approach towards the error rate. |br|
The idea is that by checking the error rate more commonly, it might do something with the efficiency. |br|


*Placeholder name* - The structural approach
-------------------------------------------------
This algorithm will divide the image up in sections with squares, check which squares are black and which are
white. Then it will start with the largest 'clusters' of uni-coloured squares and create the circles. 
It will keep doing this with squares in descending/decreasing size until it is done.

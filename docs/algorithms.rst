Algorithms tested
===================
We wanted to test more than one algorithm. This section contains the algorithms used  |br|
Algorithms that got tested was with both random aswell as systematic approaches. |br|

'Bogo place'
-----------------------
This algorithm is loosely based on the poorly optimized random algorithm 'Bogo sort', hence the given name. 
'Bogo place' works in the way that it places circles at random, with no clear structure. |br|
This algorithm was included as there was a need for a worst case scenario to compare with. |br|
It is expected that this algorithm will provide this - the worst case scenario. |br| 



Bogo feedback - Circle version
-----------------------------------------------
The same as 'Bogo place' but with a more distinct approach towards accuracy.
The first version of the modified bogo place. This one work with somewhat the same random approach, except that 
it has more focus on accuracy. This version places a set amount of circles. The biggest issue with this algorithm is that 
it might use alot of time to finish the image if too many circles is set, as shown in results. |br|

.. note:: The code for this version is not detailed in 'Scripts' or 'Code documentation' because it was a 'first draft' kind of thing
.. note:: It is very similar to the second version - the accuracy one, which is the one we ended up using.


Bogo feedback - Accuracy version
---------------------------------------
This version of the modified bogo place algorithms is set up the same way as the previous one. The only difference is 
that in this version, one sets the accuracy instead of the amount of circles. The algorithm will then place out circles at random
until the set accuracy is reached.

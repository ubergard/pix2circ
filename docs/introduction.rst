The topic we have chosen is **'pixels to circles'.** |br|
The assignment is as follows: 

::  
    
    Pixels to circles* 

    As an input, a two-dimensional image or landscape is given by an n x n square of black-and-white 
    pixels.

    Your code should create an approximation of this landscape by a set of superimposed circular disks. 
    It should aim at the best possible accuracy for a given maximum number of circular disks that can
    be varied as part of the input. It should also be able to generate a lossless representation of 
    the image/landscape using an unlimited number of circular disks.




Our **method** to deal with the task at hand was ..... |br|

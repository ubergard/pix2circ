Contribution
===================

Thanks to Martin Horsch - our lecturer who has provided us with **charmap.cpp** and **disk-vector.cpp**.
We have chosen to not include these in our code documentation, as it is not our code. 
We have added copyright in form of code blocks in the files itself.  |br|
